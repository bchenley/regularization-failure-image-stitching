# When Regularization Fails: A Study in Image Stitching

This project investigates the unintended effects of regularization methods (L2, Dropout, Early Stopping) on CNN-based local feature descriptor models in keypoint-based homography estimation and image stitching. The goal is to identify conditions under which regularization degrades descriptor performance, resulting in poor geometric alignment or unstable homographies.
